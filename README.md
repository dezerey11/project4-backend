# BATMAN COLLECTORâ€™S MARKETPLACE API

## LINK TO THE API

https://project4-classifiedads-backend.herokuapp.com/

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

- Ruby on Rails
- Postgres
- Postman

## APPROACH TAKEN

The backend of this application was coded using Ruby on Rails and served a JSON API with CRUD operations to the frontend. The user and post models were set up with a one-to-many relationship. User authentication was set up using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS/FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

- Prevent blank posts from being created
- Get new and updated posts to appear at the top of the screen
- Get new users to sign up and give them full CRUD operations on their posts
